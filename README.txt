This project was created by Bonnie Ma and Karen Liu, John Fraser SS.

It is a Discord bot tailored for use during the quarantine instituted by 
SARS-CoV-2. It has various features that should help users stay occupied 
and up-to-date while they socially distance from home.

You can use this link (https://discord.gg/s8mjtyvdHN) to join a server where 
Tina (the name of the bot) has been installed and where Karen and I 
performed many, many tests. Feel free to explore her features in the "#testing" 
channel using $help (as described in her bio).

The orginal codebase is found on repl.it, which keeps it running - the code 
found here is just a copy. 

Thanks for reading.
